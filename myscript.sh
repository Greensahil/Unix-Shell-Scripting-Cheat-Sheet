#HOW STUFF EXECURES -- These commands are interpreted and not compiled

# 1) The script is launched from within the user's login shell by typing the name of the shell script on the command line ./myscript
# 2) The user's login shell reads the first line of the script.
# 3) The shell which is named on the first line is executed and the name of the script is passed on to the new shell.
# 4) The new shell executes each line of the script file in an interpreted fashion.
# 5) The new shell exits at the end of the script.
# 6) Control is then returned to the user's original login shell which is still running.
